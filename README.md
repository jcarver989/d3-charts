# Suave Charts
Easy, reusable charts built on d3.js. All of the power, none of the complexity.

## What's Available?

1. Mulit-series Line Charts (time series or linear x-lables)
2. Bar Charts

Suave Charts are responsive by default. As a result you don't specify chart sizes in pixels, rather you supply an aspectRatio (default of 16:9)
Then when your viewport changes Suave Charts will automatically resize your charts using the aspectRatio specified. If you want to fix a chart's size
you can easily do so via CSS rules on the chart container. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Open some examples from the examples/ directory in your browser. They include both a working visual example + the code to create it.

## Documentation

## Roadmap, What's Coming?

1. Support for logarithmic scales in line/bar charts.
2. Multi-axis line charts
3. Grouped bar charts
4. Histograms
5. Smart redrawing for Ajax applications that need to add/remove data as a user selects it.
6. Pre-packaged CSS themes for charts to make it easy for non-designers to have great looking visualizations. 
7. Optional animations & transitions for when data changes to help bring attention to what data has changed.
